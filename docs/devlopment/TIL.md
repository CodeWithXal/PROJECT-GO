### Concepts

#### Express Application vs Router

- `express()` creates the main application.
- `express.Router()` creates modular route handlers.
- The application mounts routers using `app.use()`.

---

#### Middleware

Middleware executes before route handlers.

Every middleware must either:

- call `next()`, or
- send a response.

Otherwise the request hangs indefinitely.

---

#### express.json()

`express.json()` parses incoming JSON request bodies and stores the parsed object in `req.body`.

Without it:

```javascript
req.body
```

is undefined for JSON requests.

---

#### Request Lifecycle

```
Client
    ↓
Node.js
    ↓
Express
    ↓
Middleware
    ↓
Router
    ↓
Controller
    ↓
Response
```

---

#### Route Mounting

```javascript
app.use("/api/v1", healthRouter);
```

means every route inside `healthRouter` starts with `/api/v1`.

Therefore:

```javascript
router.get("/health")
```

becomes:

```
GET /api/v1/health
```

---

#### Environment Variables

- `.env` stores configuration.
- `dotenv` loads `.env` into `process.env`.
- Environment variables should never be hardcoded.

---

#### Node Modules

`package.json` stores project dependencies.

`npm install` recreates `node_modules`.

`node_modules` should never be committed to Git.

---

### Mistakes I Made

- Imported a default export using named imports.
- Mounted the router incorrectly.
- Forgot how `app.listen()` works.
- Tested `/` instead of `/api/v1/health`.

---

### Key Takeaways

- Think about architecture before syntax.
- Understand why code works.
- Test every feature before committing.
